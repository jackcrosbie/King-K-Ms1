# King K Band - MS1 Project

King K band website was set up to help the band attract potential wedding and function gigs across the country of Ireland, will a particular focus on the Cork/Munster area. This is aimed to be user friendly and provide all the information needed so that potential customers can make a decision on whether they are appropriate for what the customer needs. The website will make it easier for the band to attract new customers as well as giving the customers more information as well as an easy path to contact them through.

## UX

### User Stories

The end user or target audience of this project/website is people who are getting married and people/places that host private functions that are looking for a good band that offer something a little different to your average wedding/function band. The main age bracket of these potential clients would range from about 25 - 55 years old. 

The end user will want to get as much information on the band as possible to best guide them when making a decision/booking.
I would like to help the band increase their bookings by making the website user friendly, making it look good through a good choice of colour scheme and also making it easier for potential clients to contact the band through the "contact us" section and also through easily navigating through the social links.

- As a user I would like find out more information on the band.
- As a user I would like to find this information easily without the need for many clicks.
- As a user I would like to see videos and photos of the band in action.
- As a user I would like to see sample song lists/setlists to see what variety of music the band has to offer.
- As a user I would like to have a clear easy method of contacting the band directly.
- As a user I would like to have access to their social media through links easily available on their webpage.
- As a user I would like to see testimonials from people who have booked the band previously.
- As a user I would like to be able to view the webpage on either desktop, mobile device or tablet.

### Design

#### Color Scheme

The color scheme I chose was a mix of black, blues and purple. I felt the colors matched well while also being appropriate for a rock style band. 
Attached is the color pallete I worked from:

#### Typography

I used a combination of Lato and Roboto for my project. The Lato was used predominately for headings while the Roboto was used for the content and paragraphs. I used sans-serif as a fallback in case the fonts were not imported properly or failed to work with a specific browser.

## Strategy

### User Needs

The need of the user is be able to access the information from the website on various platforms. The information should be clear, concise and laid out in a manner that is user friendly. Everything should be only a few clicks away and not be too overloaded with information or design.

### Technical Capabilities

It is capable to do this project with the gitpod framework in a timely manner and implement things that the user needs. Creating a three page website gives each page enough information but not so much as to overload the user. The one feature I did not have time to implement, nor the information available, was an interactive calender detailing the different gigs and venues the band are playing. This would enable potential customers to come along and check them out live, therfor increasing the chance of employment. I would hope to implement this in the near future when live music is back and the band have enough gigs booked to fill out their calender.

### Business Vision

The intend purpose of this project is to advertise the client to a wider audience of potential customers. It will help potential clients contact the band as well as provide them with as much clear information as possible to help them make a decision regarding employing the band for their wedding day or private function. Their will be links to the bands social media as well to give clients more live, up-to-date information then the website will provide.

## Scope

For my audience I want to provide recordings, images and songlists to potential customers of the band. I want to provide them with a contact section to further request more information, or to propose special requests for certain songs etc, to give the band a better chance of gaining employment.

## Structure

The website will be laid out over three pages. Initally I planned to do 5 pages but upon sitting down gathering information, looking at my wireframes and my overall design I decided to reduce it to three pages. The homepage will have a header with links that lead further down the homepage like to the "About Us" section and also links to the two other pages which are "songlist" and "gallery". The reason for reducing the number of pages was I had two little contact spread across too many pages making the website overly complicated for no reason. With three pages I have enough information mixed with imagery and design that I feel it lends to an intuitive user experience with a clear layout.

After the header, containing the navigation bar, and the hero image the homepage brings you onto an "about us" section which has a little about the band overall and between three and five testimonals automatically rotating on a timed basis. The next section is covered in "About Us" is "meet the players"  section. Here we have five headshots/photos with a few lines of a bio for each band member. At the bottom of the homepage will be a "Contact Us" section which will have a form area to directly email the band as well as links to their various social media platforms. Repeated in the footer are icons to the social media links which, along with the header and nav bar, will carry across the three pages of the website.

The second page of the website is accessed via the "Songlist" link in the navigation bar. This will bring you to a simple page which contains a number of unordered list breaking the selection of songs the band does down into different catergories. Catergories such as "Wedding Songs", "70's", "80's" and so on. The footer at the bottom of the page will carry the social media icons that will link to their various social media platforms.

The final or third page of the website will bring the users to a gallery. This gallery will contain some recordings of the band playing live as well as various images of them playing different styles of gigs in numerous venues. Like the last two pages the header and navigation bar will carry across as well as the footer with the links to social media platforms.
